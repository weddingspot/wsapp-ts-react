        description: 'Settled in downtown Sacramento, the Tsakopoulos Library Galleria opened in \
                      1992 as a premier event space offering an unparalleled combination of style \
                      and space. A taste of history is experienced as the bride and groom enter \
                      through the Old Foyer of the original 1918 Library building. \
                      The five-story atrium is designed to maximize the use of both \
                      natural and artificial light. The towering glass windows and \
                      skylights give the illusion of being outside—without the risk \
                      of your wedding being rained out. The airy atrium also features \
                      several pieces of distinctive public art that will make your wedding \
                      as memorable as possible. A bronze and terrazzo floor called Codex \
                      Sacramento covers nearly 3,000 square feet of the Galleria, \
                      portraying more than 300 symbols relevant to the region and \
                      the state of California. Dozens of bronze fox statues by \
                      renowned sculptor Michael Bishop peer down from the balconies. \
                      Finally, a trio of huge glass and steel rings mounted near the \
                      ceiling, Prismatic Coronas, subtly shifts both natural and artificial \
                      light around the immense space, making the Galleria a particularly \
                      breathtaking setting for evening affairs.'
