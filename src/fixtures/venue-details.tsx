    description: 'Nestled along the pristine Carmel River banks, Gardener Ranch \
                  weaves an elegant, rustic atmosphere idyllic for outdoor weddings. \
                  The pale wooden fixtures and magical tree canopy produce a simple \
                  fairy-tale getaway, while the dependable sunshine and low humidity \
                  ensures a day to remember. The landscape, boasting 24-acres of \
                  majestic oaks and grassy meadows, is at once exclusive and genuine—a \
                  welcome balance highlighting the sanctity and romance of marriage. \
                  The graceful white of wedding dresses are accentuated by the natural \
                  greenery and the reception rooms provide an intimate setting for family \
                  and friends to celebrate. Moreover, little can surpass the nostalgic \
                  summer vibes of dancing the night away under the sparkling patio lights \
                  or indulging in festive recreational activities such as croquet and \
                  horseshoes. Gardener Ranch is truly an enchanting slice of one of \
                  California’s most treasured country escapes and a perfect venue \
                  for romance and rejoicing.',
